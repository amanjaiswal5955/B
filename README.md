# Effective Stress Prediction Model

Effective Stress prediction is a very important area in Dams construction, Reservoirs, Skyscrappers (piling Works), oil and gas exploration and production and it is done in all basins of the world where exploration wells are drilled for hydrocarbon. Sudden changes in pore pressure when drilling a well and well stability can cause major problems when one is unprepared. So, effective stress is very important to geotechnical engineer, geologists, petrophysicists, and reservoir engineers. An accurate effective stress prediction can help us to reduce drilling risk/hazard, to increase wellbore stability, to optimize casing seat selection etc.
WE will perform Following Task;
•	Importing Data
•	Data Analysis
•	Data Processing
•	Model Building
•	Hypertuning of Models

Result:  Effective stress prediction with an accuracy of 99%.
